A user-friendly, TUI-based shell script to safely and easily set the default boot entry for the GRUB bootloader. Say goodbye to manually editing configuration files and risking boot errors!

---

## ‚ú® Features

*   **Interactive TUI:** A clean `whiptail` interface guides you through the process. No more error-prone manual editing of `/etc/default/grub`!
*   **Automatic Entry Detection:** The script intelligently parses your `/boot/grub/grub.cfg` to find all available top-level and sub-menu boot entries.
*   **Safety First:**
    *   Automatically requests root permissions via `sudo`.
    *   Verifies required dependencies before running.
    *   Creates a backup of your configuration (`/etc/default/grub.bak`) before making any changes.
    *   Requires a final confirmation before applying settings and running `update-grub`.
*   **Flexible Formatting:** Lets you choose the GRUB entry format that works best for your system's configuration.
*   **Aesthetic Theming:** Includes a custom color scheme for `whiptail` to provide a more visually appealing experience.

## üñ•Ô∏è Compatibility

This script is designed for Linux distributions that use the GRUB2 bootloader, the `apt` package manager, and the `update-grub` command. It is tested and confirmed to work with:

[!Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/)
[!Debian](https://www.debian.org/)
[!Linux Mint](https://linuxmint.com/)

It should also work on most derivatives of Debian and Ubuntu.

## üõ†Ô∏è Dependencies

The script relies on a few common tools to function correctly:

*   `bash` (v4.0 or newer for associative arrays)
*   `whiptail` (provides the TUI dialog boxes)
*   `sudo` (for administrative privileges)
*   Standard GNU core utilities (`grep`, `sed`, `awk`).

The script includes pre-flight checks to ensure a safe run:
*   **Root Privileges:** It will automatically re-launch itself with `sudo` if you forget to run it as root.
*   **Whiptail Dependency:** It checks if `whiptail` is installed. If not, it will abort and **provide you with the exact command** to install it on your system.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation & Usage
